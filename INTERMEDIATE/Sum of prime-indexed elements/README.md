# Sum of prime-indexed elements
you will be given an integer array and your task is to return the sum of elements occupying prime-numbered indices.

The first element of the array is at index 0.

Good luck!

# the Catch here is DON'T over the whole list
# TO DO THIS TASK YOU MUST HAVE O(SQRT(N)) AT LEAST!!!!!!!!!
